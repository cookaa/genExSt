## A Work In Progress


GenExSt is a work-in-progress. Tests for the code will come soon and I will continue to update the repository with updates. If you would like to contribute to this project, __then please do!__ For instance, if you see some low-hanging fruit or task that you could easily complete, that could add value to the project, then I would love to have your insight.

Otherwise, please create an Issue for bugs or errors. Since I am a teaching faculty member at Allegheny College, I may not have all the time necessary to quickly fix the bugs and so I would be very happy to have any help that I can get from the OpenSource community for any technological insight. Much thanks in advance. I hope that this project helps you find the knowledge from PubMed that you require for your project. :-)
